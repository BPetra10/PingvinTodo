# **PenguinTODO**

## **Introduction**
This is a todo app with note-taking functions. Download, register, log-in, and freely use the todo and note functions.

This project was created as a class assignment, involving four people. The goal was to assess our teamwork skills, teach us a new programming language, and give us a taste of how programming functions in the real world. Even if the product isn't flawless, we had a great time working on it and we all felt like we produced our own child.
